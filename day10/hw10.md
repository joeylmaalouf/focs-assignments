## I. Logic

### 1.

The following tables are [truth tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_table).

_true_ and _false_ are represented by `T` and `F`. _OR(false, true)_ is commonly written in [infix notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infix_notation): `F OR T`.

The second table shows the value of the function _a OR b_, for all possible values _a_ and _b_. For example, _false OR true_ (the second row) has the value _true_ (the final cell of that row).

_a_ | _b_ | _a_ AND _b_
----|-----|---
 F  |  F  | F
 F  |  T  | F
 T  |  F  | F
 T  |  T  | T

_a_ | _b_ | _a_ OR _b_
----|-----|---
 F  |  F  | F
 F  |  T  | T
 T  |  F  | T
 T  |  T  | T

_a_ | _b_ | _a_ XOR _b_
----|-----|---
 F  |  F  | F
 F  |  T  | T
 T  |  F  | T
 T  |  T  | F

a. Construct the truth table for _a XOR (b XOR a)_.

_a_ | _b_ | _a_ XOR (_b_ XOR _a_)
----|-----|---
 F  |  F  | F
 F  |  T  | T
 T  |  F  | F
 T  |  T  | T

b. Which function corresponds to the English word "or", as used in "You will eat your meat OR you can't have any pudding" (where _a_ = "You will eat your meat" and _b_ = "you can't have any pudding").

XOR

## II. Questions 2â€“6 are the same as in-class activities 2-6

### 2.

Consider the following context-free grammar G:

```
E -> E+E | T
T -> TxT | (E) | a
```

Convert G to a PDA.

### 3.

Convert grammar G from (2) to Chomsky Normal Form.

```
E -> AB
A -> EY
B -> E

E -> T

T -> CD
C -> TX
D -> T

T -> FG
F -> VE
G -> W

T -> Z

V -> (
W -> )
X -> x
Y -> +
Z -> a
```

### 4.

Is the grammar G's language a regular language? If yes, produce a FSA or regular expression for this language. If not, show this. 

No, L(G) is not regular. Because We have `E -> T` and `T -> (E)`, there is potential for infinitely-growing recursion in our language. Since we have already shown that `(^n )^n` is irregular, we know that G's language L cannot be regular.

### 5.

Theorem 1: The language {a^n b^n c^n} is not a context-free language.

a. Use Theorem 1, together with the languages {a^i b^i c^j} and {a^i b^j c^j}, to show that the set of context-free languages is not closed under intersection.

The intersection of {a^i b^i c^j} and {a^i b^j c^j} is {a^n b^n c^n}, since `|a| = |b|` and `|b| = |c|` imply `|a| = |b| = |c|`. We know that {a^i b^i c^j} and {a^i b^j c^j} are context-free, but according to Theorem 1, their intersection ({a^n b^n c^n}) is not. Thus, since the intersection of two context-free languages is not context-free, the set of context-free languages is not closed under intersection.

b. Use the pumping lemma for context-free languages [Sipser pp. 125] to prove Theorem 1.

Let L be the language {a^n b^n c^n}. Assume that L is context-free, so p is its pumping length as specified by the pumping lemma for context-free languages. Take some string s, with s = a<sup>p</sup>b<sup>p</sup>c<sup>p</sup>; s is in L, and of length 3p, so it can be pumped. We know, after splitting s into some uvxyz, that v and y must not be empty. In the case that they each contain only one type of symbol, pumping to uv<sup>2</sup>xy<sup>2</sup>z guarantees that we don't increase the count of all three types of symbols, so our new string is not in L. In the case that v or y (or both) contain multiple types of symbols, then pumping to uv<sup>2</sup>xy<sup>2</sup>z guarantees that our symbols are out of order, so our new string is still not in L. Thus, we know that our assumption was false and L is not context-free.

### 6.

Consider the context-free grammar G:

```
S -> NP VP
NP -> NP PP
NP -> DET N
VP -> V NP
VP -> VP PP
DET -> a | the
N -> boy | girl | flowers | binoculars
V -> touches | sees
PP -> P NP
P -> in | from | with
```

a. Show that the string "the girl touches the boy with the flower" has two
different leftmost derivations.

`S -> NP VP -> DET N VP -> the N VP -> the girl VP -> the girl VP PP -> the girl V NP PP -> the girl touches NP PP -> the girl touches DET N PP -> the girl touches the N PP -> the girl touches the boy PP -> the girl touches the boy P NP -> the girl touches the boy with NP -> the girl touches the boy with DET N -> the girl touches the boy with the N -> the girl touches the boy with the flower`

`S -> NP VP -> DET N VP -> the N VP -> the girl VP -> the girl V NP -> the girl touches NP -> the girl touches NP PP -> the girl touches DET N PP -> the girl touches the N PP -> the girl touches the boy PP -> the girl touches the boy P NP -> the girl touches the boy with NP -> the girl touches the boy with DET N -> the girl touches the boy with the N -> the girl touches the boy with the flower`

b. Describe in English the two different meanings of this sentence.

It can mean that the girl used the flower to touch the boy, or that she touched the boy who happened to have a flower.

c. Use G to generate another ambiguous sentence.

`the boy sees a girl with binoculars`

d. Modify G so that it generates strings with adjectives: `the girl sees the tall boy`, `the girl touches the boy with a purple flower`.

Just add the following rules:

```
NP -> DET AP
AP -> A N
A -> tall | purple
```

You don't need to know this, but here's how the variable names relate to linguistics.

Variable | meaning
---|---
S | sentence
DET | determiner (article)
N | noun
NP | noun phrase
P | preposition
PP | prepositional phrase
V | verb
VP | verb phrase
